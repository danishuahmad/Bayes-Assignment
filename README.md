# Bayes Assignment - Danish Umair Ahmad

Install node-modules first.
```bash
npm run install
```
Then simply create a build.
```bash
npm run build
```
The above command will create two folders __build__ and __dist__.

Now you can simply host the application ( you must have node installed ). 
```bash
npm run start:server
```
